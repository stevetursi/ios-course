# Assignment 1: Intro to Storyboards

### PROMPT

**Goal**: Build a simple app that displays a login scene and segues into a short bio and goals for yourself.

For this first assignment you will build a simple app with a Scene that simulates a login process and a Scene that contains a short personal bio.

You'll learn how to navigate Xcode and Interface Builder and quickly prototype **multi-scene apps**.

**VIDEO:** We've outlined the steps to help you build your first assignment. Before you jump in, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/zrlmYGrtx3w) to understand how your application should function.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

### DELIVERABLES

Your app must:

* use a storyboard,
* start with a login scene with email and password text fields,
* have a login button that when tapped shows a scene with a picture,
* have buttons labeled "Info" and "Goals" that each push a new scene, and
* follow the specific requirements and constraints below.


#### View Controller 1: Login Scene

**Part 1**: Create a login scene by adding two text fields and a button that says "Submit" to the initial view controller. (Not the navigation controller.)

* Configure the first text field such that when the user taps it, the keyboard that pops up is an email-entry keyboard. The second text field should obscure the typed text (i.e. be a password field).
* Hint: When creating the second text field for the user's password, make sure you select the "Secure Text Entry" property of the `UITextField`.


#### View Controller 2: Images and Text Fields

**Part 2**: When the user taps on the "Submit" button on the login scene, the app should segue to a new view controller. 

* Create a new view controller
* When the user clicks on the "SUbmit" button, we want to start a "push segue" to the new view controller
* To set it up, control + mouse click from the "Submit" button and drag the blue line into the new scene. Let go. When the context menu appears, select "Show".
* Add a label to display your name
* Add an image
* Add two buttons, one called "Info" and one called "Goals"


#### View Controller 3: Segues

**Part 3**: When tapped, the "Info" button in the scene should display a view controller via a modal segue (animated from bottom to top). That view controller should contain a short bio of you.

* Create a new view controller and drag it into the storyboard canvas and connect a new modal segue from the "Info" button to it.
* Add a text view to the view controller and place your bio there.

**Part 4**: When tapped, the "Goals" button of the app should push segue to a new view controller. This page contains text that describes a short blurb about what youâ€™re hoping to get out of this class. The text should be red and bold. Below the text should be an image of one of your favorite things.

* Create a new view controller and drag it into the storyboard canvas and connect a new push segue from the "Goals" button to it.
* Add a image view containing an image of a cat or a dog.
* Add a text view below the image and write a short blurb explaining your goals for the course.


#### Advanced

**Part 5**: The top righthand side of the navigation bar on the "Goals" scene should have another button called "Info." When the user taps it, another scene should appear via a push segue.

* From the "Goals" view controller, add a bar button item to the right side of the navigation bar at the top.
* When tapped, the "Info" button should push the info view controller on onto the scene stack
