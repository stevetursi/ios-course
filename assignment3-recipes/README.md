# Assignment 3: UITableViewController

### Prompt
Build an app to hold recipes.

The main view controller should be a UITableViewController subclass. It should have a list of recipes to choose from. It should display, at the very least, the name of the recipe inside the UITableViewCells. If you want to show additional information, that is up to you. "Design" the app to fit your meeds.

Your app should also have a detail view controller that can display more information about each recipe. The user will get to the detail view controller by tapping on any one of the UITableViewCells inside the main UITableViewController described above. You can choose how to display the detailed information about each recipe. Again, "design" the app to fit your needs.

Your app should also have a recipe object that has the following properties: name, cooking time, description, list of ingredients, steps.

Your app should pass data between the main table view controller and the detail view controller by using the "prepareForSegue" function.

Bonus: Use Protocol Oriented Programming and make the recipe object conform to a recipe protocol.
Bonus: Insert images of the recipe that the user is viewing.
